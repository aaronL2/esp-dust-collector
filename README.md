# ESP Dust Collector

This repository contains two PlatformIO-based projects:

- `base/` – Controls the central collector and tracks stations
- `station/` – Runs on each ESP-based station, controls servo gates and reports current

Open the included `.code-workspace` file in VS Code for full multi-project development.
